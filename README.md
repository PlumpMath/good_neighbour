# Good Neighbour
Action puzzle game made with Godot Engine

## Features
* Two players
* Throwback to hit 90's TV show

## Background
Your neighbour likes to play in their backyard. Unfortunately, they keep accidentally sending their balls over to your side of the fence. Throw them back to be a good neighbour.

## Objective
Be a better neighbour than your opponent by keeping your backyard clear while theirs gets filled with balls from their own other active neighbour.

## How to play
Place balls by moving and rotating them.

There are five different sports a ball belongs to. There are two types of things thrown from your neighbour – normal and throw types. Normal types are balls from one sport. Throw types include both a hand and a ball from a sport. 

To throw back balls to your neighbour align a throw type vertically or horizontally with the same corresponding normal type ball. Any matching balls in the next space vertically or horizontally are also thrown back.

Every time you throw back four balls your opponent's neighbour will hear of your goodwill, become jealous and respond by throwing your opponent one rubber duck. Rubber ducks are thrown back when a nearby normal type ball is thrown. Subsequent balls next to rubber ducks will not be thrown.

You win when your opponent places a ball outside their backyard, out of view.
